# Instructions for use
## Clone repository
The address for this repository is:
https://github.com/nick-hunt/dotaprediction.git

Clone this onto your local machine. It is lightweight - it does not contain any data.
## Virtual environment
Open the now cloned local repository, and type "pipenv install" into the terminal. This will go through the process of creating a pipenv virtual environment with the necessary libraries and versions.
Ensure the virtual environment is activated before running any further code.
Alternatively, code can be run on the global environment providing all necessary packages are installed. Refer to the Pipfile for required libraries.
## Extracting Dota data

## Generate graph data

## Run graph neural network
